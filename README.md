# Machine_learning
Repository created for university practicals on ML methods using scikitlearn, and analyzing the findings from the models. It contains conclusive data from the models and practical code that can be used in Google Colab.

## Repository Structure

This repository is subdivided into practical tasks, with each folder containing its own testing and analysis process documented in its respective README file:

- **Linear_Model_Iris**: Linear modeling tasks using the Iris dataset
- **Classifier_Logistic_ML**: Logistic regression classifier implementations
- **Binary_HAM-SPAM_Classifier_ML**: Binary classification for HAM/SPAM detection
